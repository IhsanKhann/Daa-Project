Step 1: Setting up Git and GitHub

Install Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads

Create a GitHub account: https://github.com

Create a new repository on GitHub, e.g., DAA-Benchmark.

Step 2: Clone the repository

Open PowerShell or Terminal.

Navigate to the folder where you want to store the project:

cd C:\Users\7480\Desktop


Clone your GitHub repo:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/DAA-Benchmark.git
cd DAA-Benchmark

Step 3: Project Structure

algorithms/ → place your C++ algorithm files here (e.g., linear.cpp, binary.cpp).

launcher/ → contains the launcher code that runs benchmarks.

build/ → compiled .exe files go here (created automatically).

results/ → CSV files with benchmark results.

plots/ → optional, for generating plots later.

Tip: All paths in launcher and PowerShell scripts point to these folders.

Step 4: Installing VSCode (optional)

Download VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/

Open the project folder in VSCode: File -> Open Folder -> DAA-Benchmark

Install recommended extensions:

C/C++

Code Runner

If not using VSCode, skip this step and use PowerShell for builds and running.

Step 5: Building the project

Option 1: Using PowerShell scripts

Build all algorithms:

.\build1.ps


or

.\build2.ps


These scripts:

Create the build/ folder if missing

Compile each .cpp in algorithms/ to .exe in build/

Option 2: Using g++ manually

g++ algorithms/linear.cpp -O2 -o build/linear.exe
g++ algorithms/binary.cpp -O2 -o build/binary.exe
g++ launcher/main.cpp -O2 -o build/launcher.exe

Step 6: Running the benchmark

Navigate to the launcher folder or wherever launcher.exe is compiled:

cd build


Run the launcher:

.\launcher.exe


The program will:

Run all algorithms on all input sizes

Wait for the core to be lightly loaded (~20% usage)

Measure execution times

Save results in results/results.csv

View results by opening the CSV in Excel or a text editor.

Step 7: Customizing the benchmark

Change input sizes: edit sizes in launcher/main.cpp.

Change algorithms: add .cpp in algorithms/ and update algos & names vectors in launcher/main.cpp.

Change CPU core: modify testCore variable in launcher/main.cpp.

Change CPU load threshold: modify allowedIdlePercent (default 20 → 80% free for algorithm).

View results: open results/results.csv.

Step 8: Using GitHub

Add changes:

git add .


Commit changes:

git commit -m "Added new algorithm"


Push to GitHub:

git push origin main


Pull updates from GitHub:

git pull origin main

Step 9: Notes & Tips

Always run build scripts before running the launcher.

Keep all .cpp files in algorithms/ for easy management.

Use the same core for all tests to maintain fair comparisons.

Use plots/ folder to visualize results later.
